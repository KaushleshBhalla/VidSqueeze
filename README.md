# VidSqueeze: Basically a 𝘝̶𝘪̶𝘥̶𝘦̶𝘰̶  File Compressor

so recently i got into an habit of downloading reels as there is an option of downloading instagram reels
and soon it started taking a lot of space in my phone and i started transferring the downloaded reels to laptop and it was fun to revisit them until i started noticing red bar on my laptop storage
I dont want them in high quality taking upto 50-60 and sometimes even 100 mb of storages
so here is my super simple and handy open source video compressor...
Edit: Now a file compressor with v1.1
